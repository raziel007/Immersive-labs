IR Ep:2 Prior Attack

Analyze the MS Office file using oletools.

Using a Python script or a manual deobfuscation method, get the binary from the VBA script.

What is the name of the malicious attachment?

	****salary_ranges.docm****(python3 oledump.py -s 8 Salary-Ranges.msg)Make sure all .py files are in the same directory

What are the last 6 characters of the MD5 checksum of the malicious attachment?

	****637b7d****(~md5sum file.out)
You can get an answer for the first question using following commands:
	python3 oledump.py -p plugin_msg.py Salary-Ranges.msg
	or
		python3 oledump.py -s a Salary-Ranges.msg
		or
			python3 oledump.py -s 3 Salary-Ranges.msg
				To extract the attachment from the .msg file you have to dump it (-d) from section 4 (-s 4) and redirect output to a file:
					python3 oledump.py -d -s 4 Salary-Ranges.msg > file.out
						To get name of the file hidden in the exctracted attachment you can simply run olevba and attachemnt name as an argument:
							olevba file.out
								In the output you’ll be able to easly find the file name.

        if a == "":
            continue
        hex_kod.append(a)
 
def WriteBytes(objFile, strBytes):
    aNumbers = strBytes.split()
